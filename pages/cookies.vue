          <p>This Cookie Policy describes a bit more about how we at Instadapp use cookies and similar technologies.</p>
          <p>
            As a reminder, your use of our Services is at all times subject to our
            <nuxt-link to="/terms">Terms of Service</nuxt-link> and
            <nuxt-link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</nuxt-link> which incorporate this Cookie Policy. If you see any
            capitalized but undefined terms used in this Cookie Policy, they have the same meaning as those we give in

          <h4 id="a-cookie-policy"><strong>A. Cookie Policy</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Certain parts of our Services such as our landing page and other areas of our website use cookies and
            similar technologies such as clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage. Cookies are small files – usually
            consisting of letters and numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device, when you use
            that device to visit a website. We will refer to cookies and similar technologies simply as “Cookies” for
            the remainder of this Cookie Policy. We use Cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and
            tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the Site, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user
            base.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through cookies with other Personal
            Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us whether you have a Wallet in use on our
            Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third
            parties in order to enhance our Services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to
            you. Where we use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become
            personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, the Privacy Policy will apply in addition
            to this Cookie Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see aboutcookies.org. Most browsers have an
            option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as
            well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of
            each new cookie in a variety of ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them
            from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you
            visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work. For convenience, we recommend that you
            leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of some of our more attractive features of
            our Services, but we understand if you are uncomfortable with this and have aimed to design the fundamental
            features of our Services to be used with Cookies disabled.

            <strong>B. WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE AND FOR WHICH PURPOSES?</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Essential Cookies</strong> These are cookies that are required to provide you with features or
              services that you have requested. For example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our
              site. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Site’s performance and may make certain features and
              services unavailable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Functionality Cookies</strong> These are cookies that allow our Services to remember choices you
              make when you use our Services, such as remembering login details and changes you make to other parts of
              our Services which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to personalize your experience with
              our Services and avoid the need to re-enter certain information every time you use our Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance/Analytical Cookies</strong> Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how
              visitors use certain parts our Site such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the
              Site, what pages visitors view on our Site, and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Site.
              Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order
              to help us improve our campaigns and the Site’s content for those who engage with our advertising. We
              primarily use Google Analytics for our analytics purposes. Please see below for more information about our
              use of Google Analytics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advertising Cookies</strong> Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and
              identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. These are
              typically in the form of Cookies placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to
              those third parties about browsing habits that may help identify if certain services that such third
              parties provide are being used, identify your interests, retarget you and serve advertisements that are
              relevant to you. We do not have control or access to such third party Cookies. If you look at one page on
              our Site, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our Site or on other sites, for products referenced
              on that page or for similar products and services. We do not engage in retargeted advertising for children
              users of our Site.

          <p><strong>Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies</strong></p>
          <p>
            The types of Cookies described above may be <strong><em>session Cookies</em></strong> which are temporary
            Cookies that are only stored on your device while you are visiting our site or
            <strong><em>persistent Cookies</em></strong
            >, which are Cookies that are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent
            Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate
            account of how often you visit our Site, how often you return, how your use of the Site may vary over time,
            and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect information
            about your online activity after you leave our Site. Just like any other usage information we collect, this
            information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your browser may also offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites
            and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such
            operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our “Do Not
            Track” policy is part of our Privacy Policy and can be located there, but generally, because we do not track
            our users after they leave our Site beyond certain persistent Cookies, we do not respond to “Do Not Track”
            requests.

            server in the USA, where it is stored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because IP anonymization is activated on our Site, your IP address is abbreviated after being received by

            website, to compile reports on website activities, and to provide the website operator with additional
            services connected with website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser in connection
            with Google Analytics is not collated with other data by Google.
          </p>
