          <p>
            This Notice has been adopted in accordance with the current requirements of the California Consumer Privacy
            Act of 2018 (<strong><em>“CCPA”</em></strong
            >), and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice, unless otherwise

          </p>
          <p>
            If there are any conflicts between this Notice and any other provision of the Privacy Policy, the policy or

          <p>
            Certain Services we provide may collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably
            capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular
            consumer or household (<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, our Services may have collected the following categories of Personal Information from its
            consumers within the last twelve (12) months:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identifiers such as internet protocol (<strong>“IP”</strong>) address or e-mail address
              (<strong>“Identifiers”</strong>);
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code §
              1798.80(e)) such as financial information in the form of a Wallet address (<strong
                >“California Customer Records Information”</strong
              >);
            </li>
            <li>
              Commercial information such as records of products or services purchased, obtained or considered on the
              Ethereum network (<strong>“Commercial Information”</strong>);
            </li>
            <li>
              Internet or other similar network activity such as your interaction on the Ethereum network (<strong
                >“Network Activity Information”</strong
              >);
            </li>
            <li>
              Geolocation data such as physical location or movements (<strong>“Geolocation Information”</strong>); and
            </li>

          </ul>
          <p>Personal Information does not include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Publicly available information from government records;</li>
            <li>Deidentified or aggregated consumer information; and</li>
            <li>Information excluded from the CCPAs scope.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Instadapp obtains the categories of Personal Information described in this Notice from the sources disclosed
            in our Privacy Policy described under the section entitled “Information Instadapp Collects.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            We may use or disclose the Personal Information we collect for one or more of the business purposes listed
            in our Privacy Policy under the section entitled, “How Instadapp Uses Personal Information.” In addition, we
            generally will use your Personal Information in a manner as described to you when collecting your Personal
            Information subject to your explicit consent or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we collected
            for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Sharing Personal Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            We may share or disclose your Personal Information to third parties as described in our Privacy Policy under
            the sections entitled “How Instadapp Shares Personal Information.” When we share or disclose Personal
            Information for a business purpose to unaffiliated third parties, we enter a contract that describes the
            purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for
            any purpose except performing the contract.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><em>Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose</em></p>
          <p>
            In the preceding twelve (12) months, Instadapp’s service may have disclosed the following categories of
            Personal Information for a business purpose, primarily to our own agents or third-party services you
            interact with using our Services:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identifiers;</li>
            <li>California Customer Records Information;</li>
            <li>Commercial Information;</li>
            <li>Network Activity Information;</li>
            <li>Geolocation Information; and</li>
            <li>Inference Information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Sales of Personal Information</em></p>
          <p>
            For the purposes of the CCPA, “selling” information broadly means instances where we share Personal
            Information with partners in exchange for valuable consideration, which can include consideration that is
            not limited to an exchange of money for Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means that we may have received some kind of
            benefit to our company in return for sharing Personal Information. In response to a verified consumer
            request for categories of Personal Information "sold" we investigate and provide an individualized response
            to the consumer rather than a generic reference to our general practices outlined in this Notice, unless our
            response would be the same for all consumers and this Notice or our Privacy Policy discloses all the
            information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.
          </p>
          <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold your Personal Information.</p>
          <p><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong></p>
          <p>
            The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section
            describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
          </p>
          <p><em>Access and Data Portability Rights</em></p>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that Instadapp disclose certain information to you about our collection and
            use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable
            consumer request, we will disclose to you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The categories of Personal Information we collected about you;</li>
            <li>The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you;</li>
            <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information;</li>
            <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information;</li>
            <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you; and</li>
            <li>
              If we sold or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
            </li>
            <li>
              sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
            </li>
            <li>
              disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of
              recipient obtained.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Erasure Rights</em></p>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that Instadapp delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from
            you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
            request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our
            records, unless an exception applies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service
            provider(s) to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Complete a transaction which we collected the Personal Information for, provide a good or service that you
              requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship
              with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
            </li>
            <li>
              Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or
              prosecute those responsible for such activities;
            </li>
            <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
            <li>
              Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or
              exercise another right provided for by law;
            </li>
            <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;</li>
            <li>
              Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest
              that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the informations deletion may likely
              render impossible or seriously impair the researchs achievement, if you previously provided informed
              consent;
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your
              relationship with us;
            </li>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation; or</li>
            <li>
              Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you
              provided it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Exercising Your Rights</em></p>
          <p>
            To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described herein, please submit a verifiable
            consumer request to us at <a href="mailto:info@instadapp.io">info@instadapp.io</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your
            behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a
            verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
            period. The verifiable consumer request must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
              collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
            </li>
            <li>
              Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond
              to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity
            or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, in our
            discretion, we may consider requests made through a password protected account sufficiently verified when
            the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestors
            identity or authority to make the request.
          </p>
          <p><em>Response Timing and Format</em></p>
          <p>
            We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we
            require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will
            deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer requests
            receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
            applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that
            is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without
            hindrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
            repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why
            we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong></p>
          <p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA,
            we will not:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
            <li>
              Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other
              benefits, or imposing penalties;
            </li>
            <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or</li>
            <li>
              Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or
              quality of goods or services.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different
            prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to
            your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.
            Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at
            any time. We do not currently provide any financial incentives.
          </p>
