            >Summary: We sometimes have to change our Terms or our Services, and we can do so if we feel necessary at
            any time, but we will tell you if these changes are substantial and require that you agree to new Terms
            before continuing to use our services.</strong

        <p>
          We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change these Terms along with the
          Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your
          attention by requiring you to log in to our Services again and accept the new Terms, and/or by some other
          means. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose
          limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove
          any Content (defined below) from the Services at any time, for any reason in our sole discretion, and without

        <p>
          Our Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future.
          We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue
          using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t agree with the new Terms after any changes, you are free to reject them. Unfortunately, that
          means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the
          Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be
          effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

        <p>
          <strong
            ><em
              >Summary: Our Services allow you to import an Ethereum Wallet and interact with different decentralized
              applications. You must have your own Wallet and you understand that we do not exercise any control of your
              Wallet or any Virtual Currency you may own. You are solely responsible for your assets and the
              transactions conducted through your Wallet with our Services, even if you may not have intended to take
              certain actions or someone else has accessed your Wallet</em
            ></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services primarily consist of a web-hosted user interface on the Site and our corresponding mobile
          application(s), each of which allows you to import an Ethereum wallet capable of storing and transferring
          certain supported Virtual Currency (defined below) (your <strong>“Wallet”</strong>). After connecting a
          Wallet, you can use various aspects of our Services to manage your portfolio of Virtual Currencies and access
          and interact with certain supported decentralized protocols and decentralized applications (collectively
          <strong>“dapps”</strong>). In order to use our Services, you must already have a Wallet that is supported in
          our Services as indicated on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the dapps accessible using our Services may also involve accessing certain Virtual Currency markets,
          boards, or interfaces allowing for complex financial transactions. We also may offer certain scripts, smart
          contract interactions, or other modules that allow you to automate or combine some of these complex financial
          transactions. You understand that interacting with any of these systems or code is ultimately your own
          decision, and we have no control or responsibility for the results of your transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an Ethereum Wallet is created, a cryptographic private and public key pair is generated. The private and
          public key pair together evidence ownership/possession of a specific amount of supported Virtual Currency in
          that Wallet which enables you to send and receive Virtual Currency through the Ethereum network. The public
          key is visible to all participants in the Ethereum network. The private key must be used to transact the
          Virtual Currency represented by the corresponding public key.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some instances, depending on what other services you have used to create a Wallet, you may receive a pin
          code, create a password, or establish another method of accessing your Wallet and/or the private key to your
          Wallet as a security or convenience measure. In those cases, your authentication method may function similarly
          to a private key in that it allows you and others in possession of such information to potentially transfer
          Virtual Currency from your Wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you request to make a transfer of Virtual Currency, in order to initiate such transfer on our Services,
          you will be required to initiate a transfer from your Wallet’s interface or a web plug-in that interacts with
          our Services that may require use of your private key or other authentication method for accessing your Wallet
          (a “<strong>Transfer Initiation</strong>”). You understand and agree that we are entitled to rely on the
          Transfer Initiation and have no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity or accuracy of any Transfer
          Initiation. You will be responsible for keeping your hardware devices, including your phone, secure and for
          any activity associated with such devices and your Wallet when using our Services. We will not be responsible
          if someone else accesses your devices and authorizes a transaction upon receipt of a valid Transfer
          Initiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Regardless of your method of authentication or accessing your Wallet, we will never have access to Virtual
            Currency in your Wallet, we will not store your private key or similar methods of accessing your Wallet, and
            we will never request this information. We cannot initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency on your
            behalf.</strong

            Wallet, and you should understand the risks associated with Virtual Currency, blockchain technology
            generally, and our Services.</strong

        <p>
          <strong
            ><em
              >Summary: Virtual Currency and blockchain technology is new, and there are many risks in using this
              technology. Some of these risks relate to the technology itself, and some of them relate to the complexity
              of the transactions enabled by this technology. This is especially true with many of the decentralized
              finance dapps that you may use through our Services. While we hope our Services make these dapps more
              accessible, you alone are responsible for entering into transactions you are comfortable with and
              understand. You must agree to assume all risks of transacting with Virtual Currency through our Services,
              and you should not enter into transactions you do not understand when using our Services.</em
            ></strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to be successfully completed, any transaction created with or sent to your Wallet using our Services
          must be confirmed and recorded on the Ethereum network. We have no control over the Ethereum network or any
          other Virtual Currency and therefore cannot and will not ensure that any transaction details you submit or
          receive via our Services will be confirmed on the Ethereum network. We do not have the ability to facilitate
          any cancellation or modification requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, certain dapps may involve complex financial transactions that entail a high degree of risk, and
          we cannot assist with you any financial or technical advice with these transactions. Although certain of our
          Services may combine and automate multiple transactions into more manageable steps, you are responsible for
          understanding each of the underlying transactions if you wish to use these specific Services.

            The transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed on

            The application of existing legal and regulatory requirements to Virtual Currency and our Services is
            developing and evolving. We may rely on advice of counsel concerning the application of existing and new
            legal and regulatory requirements to its activities. This advice may require us to make sudden changes to
