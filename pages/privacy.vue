            At Instadapp, we know you care about your privacy and how your personal information is used and shared. This
            Privacy Policy is designed to help you better understand how we treat your personal information.

              >You should understand that by using or accessing our Services in any manner, you are acknowledging that
              you understand and accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you are agreeing
              to how we may collect, use, and share your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong

          </p>
          <p>
            You should also remember that your use of our Services is at all times subject to our
            <u><nuxt-link to="/terms">Terms of Service</nuxt-link></u
            >, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms we use in this Privacy Policy without
            defining them have the definitions given to them in our Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <h4 id="what-this-privacy-policy-covers"><strong>What this Privacy Policy covers</strong></h4>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”)
            that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t
            own or control, or people that we don’t manage.
          </p>
          <p>
            We understand that users of our Services value their privacy, and one of our core values is to minimize our
            collection of Personal Information. There are instances where we do collect Personal Information, however,
            and this Privacy Policy explains those instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we’ll describe further, we may gather different kinds of Personal Information from our users, and we use
            this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and
            improve our services, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use
            the Services. This Privacy Policy will also cover how we may share some Personal Information with third
            parties in specific circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are under the age of majority where you reside, you may use our Services only with the consent of or
            under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. Consistent with the requirements of the Childrens
            Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), if we learn that we have received any Personal Information directly
            from a child under age 13 without first receiving their parents verified consent, we will use that Personal
            Information only to respond directly to that child (or their parent or legal guardian) to inform them that
            they cannot use our Services and we will delete that Personal Information.
          </p>
          <h4 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy"><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></h4>
          <p>
            We are constantly trying to improve our Services and always want to adopt best practices with our privacy
            practices, so we may make changes to our Privacy Policy from time to time. When these are significant, we
            will alert you to changes and you will be required to agree to our new Privacy Policy in order to keep using
            your Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you continue to use our Services after changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, you understand
            that you are agreeing to all of those changes. Use of Personal Information we collect is subject to the
            Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information is used.
          </p>
          <h4 id="information-instadapp-collects"><strong>Information Instadapp Collects</strong></h4>
          <p>We collect different kinds of Personal Information and describe each category below.</p>
          <p>
            <em>Information You Provide to Us:</em>&nbsp;We receive and store Personal Information you knowingly provide
            to us. For example, this includes information you provide when you import your Wallet and use it with our
            Services, such as information regarding your transactional history on the Ethereum network, or information
            you provide each time you make a transfer of Virtual Currency. It also includes (i) contact information you
            elect to provide to us such as your email address, (ii) feedback and correspondence, such as information you
            provide when you report a problem with our Services or otherwise correspond with us, and (iii) marketing
            information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications like our newsletter and details
            about how you engage with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, other than the information required to associate your Wallet with our Services, you are not
            required to provide any other Personal Information to use the core features of our Services. But understand
            that you may be required to provide additional Personal Information to access certain features or offerings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >You should also understand that, unless you use certain privacy preserving tools, your entire
              transactional history conducted from your Wallet is publicly available on the Ethereum network by default
              to us and any other network participants.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Information Collected from Other Sources:</em>&nbsp;We may obtain information from other sources, such
            as third- party applications you use our Services with. We may combine this with information previously
            collected when using our Services. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of any combined
            Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Information Collected Automatically:</em>&nbsp;Whenever you interact with certain parts of our Services
            such as our landing page or blog, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from
            your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie”
            information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature
            you requested.
          </p>
          <p>
            We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies,
            embedded scripts, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, “tracking
            technologies”). “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize
            your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Site are visited and by how many
            people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your
            device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage
            patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us what topics or
            features are most interesting to potential users of our Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the
            Services interesting to as many users as possible. For more about how we use Cookies and other tracking
            technologies, see our <u><nuxt-link to="/cookies">Cookies Policy</nuxt-link></u
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >We do not automatically collect Personal Information when you conduct transactions on the Ethereum
              network using our Services, and we do not use any automatic tracking technologies in these parts of our
              Services unless you explicitly agree.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Do Not Track Policy:</em> Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal
            to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that
            you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different
            websites. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser
            you use if you do not wish to be tracked.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not track our users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and
            therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track requests. However, some third party sites do keep track of your
            browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you, and
            these third parties may not honor Do Not Track requests. Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy,
            and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your
            browser, including any third party sites we may link to. You should always review the Privacy Policy and
            specifically, the Do Not Track policy, of a third party site to understand how they will respond to Do Not
            Track requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Information we will never collect:</em> We will never ask you to share your private keys to your Wallet
            or other security information that could be used to access your Wallet without your explicit consent and
            action. Never trust anyone or any site that asks you to enter your private keys or similar security
            information.

            We do not sell Personal Information. Other than as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share
            Personal Information that you provide us with other organizations without your express consent.
          </p>
          <p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties in certain instances:</p>

            <li><strong>With your Consent:</strong> We may share Personal Information with your explicit consent.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>To our Affiliates:</strong>&nbsp;In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we’re
              affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with our Services
              (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a
              transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to
              the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or

              and may need to share your Personal Information with them to provide products or services to you or to us.
              Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share
              with them beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing the Services.

              Services to grow our business, to improve and develop our Services, and to monitor and analyze use of our
              Services. Google Analytics may collect and retain some Personal Information about you, such as the IP
              address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but not your name or other information that
              would identify you as an individual without additional information. We may combine the information

            <strong>How Instadapp Secures Personal Information</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            We always aim to ensure the privacy of the Personal Information we may collect using appropriate technical
            and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Information and how it is used. Where possible, we
            refrain from collecting Personal Information. For example, we do not collect private key data associated
            with your Wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also secure Personal Information you provide in a controlled, secure environment and protect it from
            unauthorized access. We regularly audit our system and code for security vulnerabilities. We further protect
            the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TSL/SSL), which
            encrypts all information that you input.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. The safety and security of your Personal Information
            also depends on you. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may
            compromise the security of user information at any time. Your Wallet is protected by your password, private
            key, and/or seed phrase, and we urge you to take steps to keep this and other Personal Information safe by
            not disclosing your security credentials or leaving your Wallet unsecured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless, measures we take or that you take will not guarantee that your Personal Information will not be
            accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of these security measures. By using our Services, you
            acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

            When we talk about these additional GDPR rights, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they
            are defined in the GDPR, but generally, “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” means information that can be used
            to individually identify a person, and “<strong>processing</strong>” covers actions that can be performed in
            connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.

              enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process Personal Data due to contractual necessity,
              failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the

              override those interests. In assessing whether there is a legitimate interest, we consider and balance
              potential impacts on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal
              Data. We will not process your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by any
              adverse impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
              Examples of these legitimate interests include, operation and improvement of our Services, provision of
              customer support, protection from fraud or security threats, or completion of corporate transactions.

              <strong>Consent</strong>:&nbsp;In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly
              grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will
              be indicated to you at the point and time we collect that Personal Data.

            <li>
              <strong>Other Processing Grounds:</strong>&nbsp; We may also occasionally need to process Personal Data to
              comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data
              subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.

            your personal information is given the same protection it has in Europe.
